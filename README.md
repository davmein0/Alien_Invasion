# Alien Invasion 
A version of Space Invaders -- an arcade-style shooter game made with Pygame.  

Based on a project found in Eric Matthes' book _Python Crash Course: 3rd Edition_ 
This project was mainly a way to create something creative and enjoyable, as well as to practice Python.  

# How to Play:
Player can move the ship to the right or left using the right/left arrow keys, and press the spacebar to fire bullets. Shoot the aliens to get a higher score, and don't let the aliens get past the ship! Shoot buffs, avoid debuffs, and hit the mines. The aliens come in waves, and they get faster as the time progresses. You have 3 lives: make each one count!

# Source Code:
_alien_invasion.py_ is the base file, and the other _.py_ files contain source code for different powerups, game mechanics (like settings and scoreboard), and pieces (ship and alien). 

The _Images_ and _Sounds_ contain the pictures, sound effects, and sound tracks.
